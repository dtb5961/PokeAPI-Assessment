# PokeAPI Assessement

This Console app will take a Pokemon Name and generate a list of the pokemon types it is strong against and weak against.

Poke API will be used https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#info

There will be two calls to the PokeAPI

1. A call using the input pokemon name to confirm it exists/ get pokemon attrbutes
   https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/

2. A call using the types from the pokemon to get the damage relations
   https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/{id or name}/
